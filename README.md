# nevis-CNN

This repo contains 1 Jupyter notebook (starter code) and 2 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models written in Terraform and Keras. The models reference high-performing, industry-standard ResNet and VGG16. 

vgg16b_tf.ipynb: vgg16 model using terraform 
run_resnet14b.py: resnet14 model using keras

For detailed instructions on how to run these Jupyter notebooks, or rationale behind some of the parameters set for the ML models, please see this google doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jElkhcZG15OG6Azza3dgda2aagX1vHUS5YlMw8LcOBc/edit?usp=sharing
